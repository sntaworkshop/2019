&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Title: Performance and Security Challenges in Science Workflows (<a href="/snta/2019/snta19-ghosal-keynote.pdf">slides</a>)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract (<a href="/snta/2019/snta19-kn-abstract.pdf">PDF</a>): 
Scientific workflows are complex, often generating large amounts of data that need to be processed in multiple stages. The data often generated at remote locations must be transferred from the source and between the distributed HPC nodes interconnected by high-speed networks that carry other background traffic. Increasingly, many of these  scientific workflows require processing to be completed within a deadline, which, in turn, imposes deadline on the network data transfer. 

To help facilitate the movement of large science data, many organizations utilize data transfer nodes (DTNs). An important aspect of a DTN based network architecture is the security issue, which is addressed by the Science DMZ model. DTNs can become a critical point of failure in a Science DMZ if performance becomes compromised due to security attacks. 

In this talk we will discuss the performance and security challenges of science workflows. With regards to the deadline driven data transfers,  we will discuss the challenges in designing the network controller. We will discuss the need for  a  two-level autonomous control system; at the network level and at the end system.

With respect to the security issues we will consider various types external denial-of-service attacks as well as insider attacks such as as data exfiltration and data corruption. We will discuss system performance metrics to identify standard DoS attack directed at DTNs and anomaly detection system based on Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) to detect  detecting performance anomalies.

Professor Dipak Ghosal has been with the Faculty of the Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, CA, USA, since 1996, and he is the chair of the Graduate Group of Computer Science. 
He received the B.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India, in 1983, the M.S. degree in computer science from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India, in 1985, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the University of Louisiana, Lafayette, LA, USA, in 1988. 
From 1988 to 1990, he was a Research Associate in the Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Maryland at College Park. From 1990 to 1996, he was a member of Technical Staff with Bell Communications Research (Bellcore and later Telcordia), Red Bank, NJ. 
His research interests include control and management of high-speed networks, wireless and vehicular ad hoc networks, parallel and distributed computing, and performance evaluation of computer and communication systems.
